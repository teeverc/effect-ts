# HTTP Client (effect/unstable/http)

Use this guide when making outbound HTTP requests.

## Mental model

- `HttpClient` is a service provided by a platform layer (Fetch, Node, Bun).
- Requests are built with `HttpClientRequest` and executed with `HttpClient.execute`.
- Non-2xx responses are not failures unless you filter status codes explicitly.
- `HttpClient` currently lives under `effect/unstable/http` in v4.

## Patterns

- Build requests with `HttpClientRequest.get/post` and set headers/body.
- Validate status with `HttpClientResponse.filterStatusOk` (or `HttpClient.filterStatusOk` on a client).
- Decode JSON with `HttpClientResponse.schemaBodyJson`.
- Retry with `Effect.retry` and a capped `Schedule`.

## Walkthrough: GET + status check + decode

```ts
import * as Effect from "effect/Effect"
import * as Schedule from "effect/Schedule"
import * as Schema from "effect/Schema"
import { HttpClient, HttpClientRequest, HttpClientResponse } from "effect/unstable/http"

const User = Schema.Struct({
  id: Schema.Number,
  name: Schema.String
})

const request = HttpClientRequest.get("https://api.example.com/users/1")

const program = HttpClient.execute(request).pipe(
  Effect.flatMap(HttpClientResponse.filterStatusOk),
  Effect.flatMap(HttpClientResponse.schemaBodyJson(User)),
  Effect.retry(
    Schedule.exponential("100 millis").pipe(
      Schedule.jittered,
      Schedule.recurs(2)
    )
  )
)
```

## Wiring guide

- Provide a client layer such as `FetchHttpClient.layer` from `effect/unstable/http/FetchHttpClient` (web) or `@effect/platform-node/NodeHttpClient` (Node) / `@effect/platform-bun` (Bun).
- Apply retries only to idempotent requests.
- Keep decoding at the boundary and return typed values to the rest of the app.

## Pitfalls

- Treating non-2xx responses as success (use status filters).
- Retrying non-idempotent requests without a dedupe token.
- Missing a platform client layer in the environment.
