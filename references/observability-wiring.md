# Observability Wiring (Layers and Runtime)

Use this guide when wiring logging, metrics, or tracing into an app.

## Patterns

- Provide loggers at the edge.
- Provide tracing layers before running effects.
- Keep exporters in layers.
- OTLP helpers live in `effect/unstable/observability`; OpenTelemetry SDK layers live in `@effect/opentelemetry`.

## Walkthrough: tracing layer

```ts
import * as Effect from "effect/Effect"
import * as NodeSdk from "@effect/opentelemetry/NodeSdk"
import { InMemorySpanExporter, SimpleSpanProcessor } from "@opentelemetry/sdk-trace-base"

const TracingLive = NodeSdk.layer(Effect.sync(() => ({
  resource: { serviceName: "app" },
  spanProcessor: [new SimpleSpanProcessor(new InMemorySpanExporter())]
})))

const program = Effect.withSpan("work")(Effect.void).pipe(
  Effect.provide(TracingLive)
)
```
